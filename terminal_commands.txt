# 1. First, fix the commit command
git commit -m "Initial commit for College Club website"

# 2. Check which branch you're on
git branch

# 3. If you don't see any branch or you're on master instead of main, do this:
git checkout -b main  # This creates and switches to a main branch

# 4. Now try pushing again
git push -u origin main
